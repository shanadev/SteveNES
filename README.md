Steve's Nintendo Emulator

I've always wanted to make an emulator. It hits so many of my interests: music, programming, video games, following rules and solving puzzles. I didn't feel programming something like that was quite in reach until I saw javidx's YouTube video series on making a NES emulator. He did great at breaking it down enough to feel like it was something I could tackle.

My goal here is to niavely follow javidx's videos and make what he made. Then I'd like to go back and make it my own in some way - even if it's just cleaning up the code and writing it how I would like to see it along with comments in my own words to seal in the learning.

I'm on a Mac using Visual Studio 2022 - I'm using C# dotnet 6. For graphics, I'm using the SDL library with the C# bindings provided.

I have a "Display Engine" project that is sort of javidx's Pixel Game Engine, or it does the task.

The rest is the NES.
